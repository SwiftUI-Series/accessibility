# Accessibility

Start from a sample project that is unusable for a lot of users with disabilities and make it as accessible as you can! Show the world how easy it is to make accessible apps with SwiftUI, there are no excuses!

- Download the InAccessible sample app code (COMING SOON).
- Your challenge is to adjust the app and make it as accessible and inclusive as possible!
- You can choose to focus on a particular type of accessibility technique, or go for a more broad approach
- Create a new public repo and write a short piece of text or record a short video explaining your approach
- Upload your improved version of the InAccessible app to a public GitHub repo and add it to this repo in a PR.
- The judges will check your app for accessibility and inclusiveness. We'll look for the obvious things such as Dynamic Type, but surprise us! If there's anything in particular you'd like the judges to look out for, be sure to mention it.
